## **What is Secrets?**
Secrets is a project developed with the goal of testing out new authentication skills I've learned such as hashing and salting passwords, oauth 2.0 with google and also with facebook, once authentication is complete, and the session is running, the user can then submit secrets that will be available for everyone in the web to see, but they secrets are not going to be linked to this user publicly, only saved on mongoDB. So basically, only the users who were authenticate by google, facebook, or my local passport authenticator, will be able to submit secrets,  while the other can only see the secrets.

## ***Technologies used:***
